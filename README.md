## 1. Introduction

Our group’s project build is designed as an Intel-based entry-level gaming PC. The main goal is to provide a budget-friendly system capable of running modern games at 900p to 1080p resolution, as well as handling general computing tasks such as programming and school-related workloads.

We worked with a ₱40,000 budget (+/- 5%), focusing on maximizing gaming performance within the cost limit. The build balances CPU performance, GPU capability, and sufficient storage while maintaining future upgradability.

## 4. Compatibility Justification
For each part, explain compatibility and choices.
Example:
- **CPU + Motherboard**: Intel i5-12400F uses the LGA1700 socket, supported by the MSI PRO H610M-G DDR4 motherboard.
(LGA1700 socket, BIOS compatible).
- **RAM**: DDR4-3200 supported by the motherboard; dual-channel improves gaming performance.
- **Storage**: NVMe SSD fits in the M.2 slot, HDD supported by SATA ports.
- **GPU**: RTX 3050 fits in the case and power requirements are covered by the 650W PSU.
- **PSU**: 650W Bronze-rated PSU is sufficient for this build, with some headroom.
- **Case + Cooling**: The MSI MAG FORGE 100R provides airflow and space for ATX motherboards. Additional Corsair AF120 fans improve thermals.

## 5. Budget Analysis
- **Budget Limit**: ₱42,000
- **Final Total**: ₱41,155
- **Within budget ✅**
- **Trade-offs**: Stuck with DDR4 instead of DDR5 to save cost, but still sufficient for entry-level gaming. Aftermarket cooler included for thermal performance and noise reduction, though stock cooler could have reduced cost further.

## 6. Conclusion & Learnings
Through this project, we learned how to balance performance vs. cost when building PCs. International PCPartPicker builds sometimes show cheaper alternatives, but local availability and vendor pricing in Manila can vary significantly.

We also realized the importance of compatibility checking (socket, clearance, PSU wattage, and case size) to avoid issues during assembly. This exercise gave us a clearer understanding of how each PC component contributes to performance and budget constraints.
